          <h1>Socrates.</h1>
          <p>
            Socrates was a scholar, teacher and philosopher born in ancient
            Greece. His Socratic method laid the groundwork for Western systems
            of logic and philosophy. When the political climate of Greece turned
            against him, Socrates was sentenced to death by hemlock poisoning in
            399 B.C. He accepted this judgment rather than fleeing into exile.

        <h2>Early Years</h2>
        <p>
          Socrates was born and lived nearly his entire life in Athens. His
          father Sophroniscus was a stonemason and his mother, Phaenarete, was a
          midwife. As a youth, he showed an appetite for learning. Plato
          describes him eagerly acquiring the writings of the leading
          contemporary philosopher Anaxagoras and says he was taught rhetoric by
          Aspasia, the talented mistress of the great Athenian leader Pericles.
          Did you know? Although he never outright rejected the standard
          Athenian view of religion, Socrates' beliefs were nonconformist. He
          often referred to God rather than the gods, and reported being guided
          by an inner divine voice. His family apparently had the moderate
          wealth required to launch Socrates’ career as a hoplite (foot
          soldier). As an infantryman, Socrates showed great physical endurance
          and courage, rescuing the future Athenian leader Alcibiades during the
          siege of Potidaea in 432 B.C. Through the 420s, Socrates was deployed
          for several battles in the Peloponnesian War, but also spent enough
          time in Athens to become known and beloved by the city’s youth. In 423
          he was introduced to the broader public as a caricature in
          Aristophanes’ play “Clouds,” which depicted him as an unkempt buffoon
          whose philosophy amounted to teaching rhetorical tricks for getting
          out of debt.

        <h2>Philosophy</h2>
        <p>
          Although many of Aristophanes’ criticisms seem unfair, Socrates cut a
          strange figure in Athens, going about barefoot, long-haired and
          unwashed in a society with incredibly refined standards of beauty. It
          didn’t help that he was by all accounts physically ugly, with an
          upturned nose and bulging eyes. Despite his intellect and connections,
          he rejected the sort of fame and power that Athenians were expected to
          strive for. His lifestyle—and eventually his death—embodied his spirit
          of questioning every assumption about virtue, wisdom and the good
          life. Two of his younger students, the historian Xenophon and the
          philosopher Plato, recorded the most significant accounts of Socrates’
          life and philosophy. For both, the Socrates that appears bears the
          mark of the writer. Thus, Xenophon’s Socrates is more straightforward,
          willing to offer advice rather than simply asking more questions. In
          Plato’s later works, Socrates speaks with what seem to be largely
          Plato’s ideas. In the earliest of Plato’s “Dialogues”—considered by
          historians to be the most accurate portrayal—Socrates rarely reveals
          any opinions of his own as he brilliantly helps his interlocutors
          dissect their thoughts and motives in Socratic dialogue, a form of
          literature in which two or more characters (in this case, one of them
          Socrates) discuss moral and philosophical issues, One of the greatest
          paradoxes that Socrates helped his students explore was whether
          weakness of will—doing wrong when you genuinely knew what was
          right—ever truly existed. He seemed to think otherwise: people only
          did wrong when at the moment the perceived benefits seemed to outweigh
          the costs. Thus the development of personal ethics is a matter of
          mastering what he called “the art of measurement,” correcting the
          distortions that skew one’s analyses of benefit and cost. Socrates was
          also deeply interested in understanding the limits of human knowledge.
          When he was told that the Oracle at Delphi had declared that he was
          the wisest man in Athens, Socrates balked until he realized that,
          although he knew nothing, he was (unlike his fellow citizens) keenly
          aware of his own ignorance.

        <h2>Trial and Death</h2>
        <p>
          Socrates avoided political involvement where he could and counted
          friends on all sides of the fierce power struggles following the end
          of the Peloponnesian War. In 406 B.C. his name was drawn to serve in
          Athens’ assembly, or ekklesia, one of the three branches of ancient
          Greek democracy known as demokratia. Socrates became the lone opponent
          of an illegal proposal to try a group of Athens’ top generals for
          failing to recover their dead from a battle against Sparta (the
          generals were executed once Socrates’ assembly service ended). Three
          years later, when a tyrannical Athenian government ordered Socrates to
          participate in the arrest and execution of Leon of Salamis, he
          refused—an act of civil disobedience that Martin Luther King, Jr.
          would cite in his “Letter from a Birmingham Jail.” The tyrants were
          forced from power before they could punish Socrates, but in 399 he was
          indicted for failing to honor the Athenian gods and for corrupting the
          young. Although some historians suggest that there may have been
          political machinations behind the trial, he was condemned on the basis
          of his thought and teaching. In his “The Apology of Socrates,” Plato
          recounts him mounting a spirited defense of his virtue before the jury
          but calmly accepting their verdict. It was in court that Socrates
          allegedly uttered the now-famous phrase, “the unexamined life is not
          worth living.” His execution was delayed for 30 days due to a
          religious festival, during which the philosopher’s distraught friends
          tried unsuccessfully to convince him to escape from Athens. On his
          last day, Plato says, he “appeared both happy in manner and words as
          he died nobly and without fear.” He drank the cup of brewed hemlock
          his executioner handed him, walked around until his legs grew numb and
          then lay down, surrounded by his friends, and waited for the poison to
          reach his heart.

        <h2>Socratic Legacy</h2>
        <p>
          Socrates is unique among the great philosophers in that he is
          portrayed and remembered as a quasi-saint or religious figure. Indeed,
          nearly every school of ancient Greek and Roman philosophy, from the
          Skeptics to the Stoics to the Cynics, desired to claim him as one of
          their own (only the Epicurians dismissed him, calling him “the
          Athenian buffoon”). Since all that is known of his philosophy is based
          on the writing of others, the Socratic problem, or Socratic
          question–reconstructing the philosopher’s beliefs in full and
          exploring any contradictions in second-hand accounts of them–remains
          an open question facing scholars today. Socrates and his followers
          expanded the purpose of philosophy from trying to understand the
          outside world to trying to tease apart one’s inner values. His passion
          for definitions and hair-splitting questions inspired the development
          of formal logic and systematic ethics from the time of Aristotle
          through the Renaissance and into the modern era. Moreover, Socrates’
          life became an exemplar of the difficulty and the importance of living
          (and if necessary dying) according to one’s well-examined beliefs. In
          his 1791 autobiography Benjamin Franklin reduced this notion to a
          single line: “Humility: Imitate Jesus and Socrates.”

          Socrates had it right. Remain humble and appreciate the fact that you
          don’t know everything. What you do have, and must strive to retain, is
          the desire and ability to continually learn, ask questions, and grow,
          both inwardly and outwardly. Thankfully, one’s search for knowledge
          has no end as there is always something new to learn, giving one’s
          life meaning and purpose. The choice, however, is yours to make.
